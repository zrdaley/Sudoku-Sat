Additionally a log file (`minisat_hi_puzzle_logs.txt`) consisting of the CPU time to solve each puzzle will be created.

## Creating the Executable

In order to run the python files using just the filename (without the extension), a symbolic link is created between the `*.py` file and the target executable.
