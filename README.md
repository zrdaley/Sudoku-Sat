- Makefile
    - how to run:
        - `$ make target`: this will install python and create the executables
        - `$ make clean`: this will delete the executables
        - `$ make puzzles-sat`: this runs `sud2sat` on [this list of puzzles](projecteuler.net/project/resources/p096_sudoku.txt). The output files will be located in `./sud2sat_puzzle_output`.
        - `$ make puzzles-minisat`: this will run minisat on all of the files in `./sud2sat_puzzle_output`. The output files will be located in `./minisat_puzzle_output`. Additionally a log file (`minisat_puzzle_logs.txt`) consisting of the CPU time to solve each puzzle will be created.

## Creating the Executable

In order to run the python files using just the filename (without the extension), a symbolic link is created between the `*.py` file and the target executable.
